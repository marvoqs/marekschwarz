        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Marek Schwarz and I decided to change my profession after seven years of working in business. My main strengths have always been logical
          and strategic thinking and working with people, including leading a team of colleagues. Web application development was my hobby and passion as a
          child, so I decided to pursue it again. I started learning from the very beginning to learn all the new trends and technologies and I soon realized
          that I had set out in the right direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I feel confident enough to apply for a job as a junior full stack web developer. I am ready for long-time cooperation where I will be able to
          further grow and learn about new approaches in web development.
